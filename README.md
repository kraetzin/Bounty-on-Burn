# Bounty-on-Burn

This is my spin on the bounty on bury mod. Let me know if anything should be added/removed or changed a bit. Hope you enjoy it.


- Burn corpses for cash or karma!
- Use any item that is on fire (aka "lit") or a steel and flint, to burn the corpses of slain creatures and players.

- Activate your lit item or steel and flint, must be in your inventory(not in your backpack), right-click the corpse and choose burn body.

- Configurable to set 2 different fire graphics, amount of coin gained, amount of karma gained, the action time, the ability to burn corpses in forges/ovens/etc, and the message the player receives on burning.

- Dragons and uniques cannot be burned.
